    CELEBRITY MUG SHOTS: HOT OR NOT?? - https://web.archive.org/web/20070703052539/http://cbs2.com/slideshows/photoalbum_slideshow_212104643
      I made this at 11:30 pm to see if the CMS had content/radio button customization in captions and content for slideshows. It was the literal top everything feature every single day from some time in spring 2007 until they changed servers and that wasn’t including the fact that every single station cloned it and self-hosted because it was trouncing everything in ratings. 
      It was the first interactive slideshow of nothing content because I was bored, became a template for clickbait and sometimes I hunt down really shitty useless online design/content combos to see if it’s my horrible bastard kid that got away too quickly to keep it controlled.
